//  This module provides a very barebones loading screen.  Most of the time you
//  will not need a loading screen, because the assets will load so fast.  But
//  just in case, this is a simple example you can use in your games.
//
//  We know from 3152 that you all like to customize this screen.  Therefore,
//  we have kept it as simple as possible so that it is easy to modify. In
//  fact, this loading screen uses the new modular JSON format for defining
//  scenes.  See the file "loading.json" for how to change this scene.

/**
 * This class is a simple loading screen for asychronous asset loading.
 *
 * The screen will display a very minimal progress bar that displays the
 * status of the asset manager.  Make sure that all asychronous load requests
 * are issued BEFORE calling update for the first time, or else this screen
 * will think that asset loading is complete. 
 *
 * Once asset loading is completed, it will display a play button.  Clicking
 * this button will inform the application root to switch to the gameplay mode.
