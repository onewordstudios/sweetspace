# Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)

This template provides a base for you to build off of.  You should add all of your
files to sources and assets, as appropriate.  This will allow access to the Apple,
Android, and Windows IDEs.

You will need to make changes to the project to give it a different name and package
identifier (to prevent your application from clashing with others).  See the course 
web page for instructions
