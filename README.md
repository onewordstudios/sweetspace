Cosmic radiation is tearing through your ship, and you’re the only donuts who can stop it! Donut waste time as you roll and patch your way through these bite-sized holes in your ship. You’ll need to communicate and cooperate to achieve your dream of a sweet, sweet space.

A game developed by [onewordstudios](https://onewordstudios.fun) for CS 4152 at Cornell University.

Coming August 2020 to Android and iOS.
