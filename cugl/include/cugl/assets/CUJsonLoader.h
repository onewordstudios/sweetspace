//
//  This module provides a specific implementation of the Loader class to load
//  (non-directory) json assets.  It is essentially a wrapper around JsonReader
//  that allows it to be used with AssetManager.
//
//  As with all of our loaders, this loader is designed to be attached to an
//  asset manager.  In addition, this class uses our standard shared-pointer
//  architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
