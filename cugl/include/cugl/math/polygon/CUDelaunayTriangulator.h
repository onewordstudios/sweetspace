//  This module is a factory for a Delaunay triangulator.  Delaunay support is
//  not necessary for texture tesselation, but it is useful for applications
//  like HRTF support that require certain geometric guaranties on the
//  triangulation.  In addition, this triangulator can be used to extract the
//  Voronoi diagram as well.
//
//  Because math objects are intended to be on the stack, we do not provide
//  any shared pointer support in this class.

/**
 * This class is a factory for producing solid Poly2 objects from a set of vertices.
 *
 * For all but the simplist of shapes, it is important to have a triangulator
 * that can divide up the polygon into triangles for drawing.  This is triangulator
 * uses the Bowyer-Watson algorithm to perform a Delaunay triangulation.  This
 * triangulation minimizes sliver triangles, which are common with ear clipping
 * algorithms {@see SimpleTriangulator}.
 *
 * Because the Voronoi diagram is the dual of the Delaunay triangulation, this
 * factory can be used to extract this diagram. The Voronoi diagram can be
 * extracted as either a wireframe or a collection of regions.
 *
 * As with all factories, the methods are broken up into three phases:
 * initialization, calculation, and materialization.  To use the factory, you
 * first set the data (in this case a set of vertices or another Poly2) with the
 * initialization methods.  You then call the calculation method.  Finally,
 * you use the materialization methods to access the data in several different
 * ways.
 *
 * This division allows us to support multithreaded calculation if the data
 * generation takes too long.  However, note that this factory is not thread
 * safe in that you cannot access data while it is still in mid-calculation.
