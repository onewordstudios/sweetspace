/**
 * This class provides a graph node interface for an audio recording device.
 *
 * This audio node provides a modern, graph-based approach to sound design.
 * This input can be plugged into the audio graph and piped to the output
 * device with a small (but significant) amount of latency.  This node is
 * intended to be the root of an audio DAG, much like {@link AudioPlayer}.
 *
 * One of the important issues to understand about this class is that there
 * are actually two different latency values: the recording latency and the
 * playback latency.  The recording latency is time from when the data is
 * captured at the hardware device and is recorded at this node.  It is
 * entirely determined by the buffer size of this device, much like the
 * buffer determines the playback latency for {@link AudioOutput}.  However,
 * unlike AudioOutput, there is no guarantee that recording happens at uniform
 * time intervals. For example, on MacOS at 48000 Hz, a buffer size of 512 will
 * record twice (in immediate sucession) every 21 ms instead of once every
 * 11 ms (a buffer size of 1024 appers to record once every 21 ms as expected).
 *
 * The playback latency is the time from when data is passed to {@link record()}
 * and made available to {@link read()}; it does not include the latency of
 * any output device.  It is determined by the additional delay value, which is
 * the number of frames that must be recorded before any can be read.  So a
 * delay of 0 means that data is instantly available, while a delay of the
 * buffer size means that no data can be read until more than a single buffer
 * has been recorded (which means that at least two buffers worth of data must
 * have been recorded).  Because output and input devices run in different
 * threads and have no coordination at all, a delay of at least one buffer is
 * recommended for real-time playback.
 *
 * This method has no public initializers or non-degenerate constructors. That
 * is because all input nodes should be created by the factory methods in
 * {@link AudioManager}.  That way, the AudioManager can properly handle device
 * conflicts as they may arise.
 *
 * Audio devices in SDL are identified by name. If you have two devices with
 * the same name, SDL will add a distinguishing index to the name. You can
 * see the list of all available devices with the {@link AudioManager#devices()}
 * method.  In addition, the empty string may be used to refer to the default
 * devices.  Instances of AudioOutput attached to a default device will roll
 * over (if possible) whenever the default device changes.
 *
 * The audio graph should only be accessed in the main thread.  In addition,
 * no methods marked as AUDIO THREAD ONLY should ever be accessed by the
 * user.
 *
 * This class does not support any actions for the {@link AudioNode#setCallback}.
